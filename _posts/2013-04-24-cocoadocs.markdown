Cocoadocs is a project grown out of [Cocoapods](http://cocoapods.org) which generates 18GB of documentation for almost all of cocoapods' pods. It fills a gap in the ecosystem by taking the issue of hosting and discoverability for documentation out of the hands of individual developers and into one single source.

 About the event
----

This is the first NSManchester event since [@daveverwer](http://twitter.com/daveverwer) and the first one hosted by [orta](http://orta.github.io) so we'll be experimenting with the format. Orta will be around from 6 setting up the room and will be free to discuss dev with anyone wanting to come early.
